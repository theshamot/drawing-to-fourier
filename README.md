# drawing-to-fourier
Work on project will begin sometime in future. This thing should convert single-line or multi-line paths (sets of consecutive points) to fourier series and to create some fancy graphs..fourierdrawings. This project will be coded for fun. Inspiration from https://youtu.be/r6sGWTCMz2k
